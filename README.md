L'Italiano secondo il Metodo Natura

This repo is to create well structured data from the book.

The problems are:

The first few chapters have interleaved text with a non IPA pronunciation.

The rest of the book uses diacritic marks to indicate stress which makes the
word appear to be non-standard to dictionary lookup apps.

The marginalia make OCR difficult. It must be removed before OCR.
